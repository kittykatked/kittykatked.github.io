<h1>About Me</h1>
<p1>I am a senior Journalism and Mass Communication Major with a Spanish minor at Bob Jones University, Greenville, SC. I am currently pursuing a concentration in public relations. Click here <a href=“http://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstendavis1”>on the link</a> to view my LinkedIn account. You can also click <a href=“https://totheoaksite.wordpress.com/”>here</a> to view my blog and to see some examples of my writing abilities. </p>
<h2></h2>
<p2>I also recently discovered an art talent that I am still developing. I enjoy portrait and landscape painting with acrylic paints, but I am familiar with watercolor and oil as well. My particular talent is in portrait drawings which I discovered and began to develop about a year ago.</p>
<h3><h/3>
<p3>I enjoy spending time with my family and friends in Pennsylvania, and I would love to meet you sometime.</p>
